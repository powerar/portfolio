                My name is Andrew Power and I am eager to begin a career in the
                exciting and ever-changing field of web development. My years of
                experience in the application support sector gives me a unique
                perspective on the importance of the user experience. Throughout
                my career I have developed exceptional client-handling skills as
                well as the ability to meet tight deadlines and engage in
                creative problem-solving. I love to learn and I bring this
                enthusiasm to every project. You can find a link to some of my
                projects in the "Work" section of this page. Additionally my
                development proficiencies are listed on the "Resume" section.
