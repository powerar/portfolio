            My name is Andrew Power and I am eager to begin a career in the exciting and ever-changing field of web
            development. My years of experience in the application support sector gives me a unique perspective on the
            importance of the user experience. Throughout my career I have developed exceptional client-handling skills
            as well as the ability to meet tight deadlines and engage in creative problem-solving. I love to learn
            and I bring this enthusiasm to every project.
