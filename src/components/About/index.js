            My name is Andrew Power and I am eager to begin a career in the
            exciting and ever-changing field of web development. My years of
            experience in the application support sector gives me a unique
            perspective on the importance of the user experience. Throughout my
            career I have developed exceptional client-handling skills as well
            as the ability to meet tight deadlines and engage in creative
            problem-solving. I love to learn and I bring this enthusiasm to
            every project.
