         I have of 8 years experience as an enterprise application specialist. In my role I have acquired a wealth of knowledge about the client experience.
         As a result, I have developed exceptional client-handling skills, creative problem-solving, and the ability to deal with tight deadlines. For this work I

         Enterprise support and my desire to want to know why and how things work has pushed me into web development. This experience combined with coding bootcamps
         has given me proficiencies in the AGILE development cycle, troubleshooting and debugging, and logging enhancement requests. I have
         excellent knowledge in the MERN-stack, and especially in server-side configuration and database development.
