         I have a combined experience of 8 years as an enterprise application specialist. Through this work I have been able to understand a lot about the client experience.
         In my work I have developed exceptional client-handling, problem-solving,  and the ability to keep cool under pressure. For this work I have employee awards
         and delivered best-in-class customer service and NPS scores.

         Enterprise support and my natural inclination to want to know why and how things work has pushed me into web development. My experience in support and coding bootcamps
         have given me skills in the AGILE development cycle, troubleshooting and logging bugs, entering enhancement requests, and debugging code. As my experience outlines, I have
         excellent knowledge in the MERN-stack, and especially in back-end systems and database development.
