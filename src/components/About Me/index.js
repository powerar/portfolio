         I have a combined experience of 8 years as an enterprise application specialist. Through this work I have been able to understand a lot about the client experience.
         With my work experience I have developed exceptional client-handling skills, problem-solving skills, and the ability to keep cool under pressure. 

         Enterprise support and my natural inclination to want to know why and how things work has pushed me into web development. I love to learn and acquire new skills, and
         the development environment helps me bring passion to every project I create.
